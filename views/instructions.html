         <br>You can pass a URL as a parameter and receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.</br>
         <br>If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format,
         the JSON response will contain an error instead.</br>
         </br>As an example, Google which has the URL https://www.google.com </br>
         </br>can be added to our database by pasing a URL with this format</br>
         </br></br>
         <br>https//jbrierty-urlshortener.herokuapp.com/new/https://www.google.com<br>
         </br></br>
         </br>After you add a URL to the our database you will be given a new URL to return to that sight.</br>
         </br>You can get back to Google by going to<br>
         <br> https//jbrierty-urlshortener.herokuapp.com/2</br>
         <br>Right now this sight only accepts URLs that start with "https://www." or "http://www." and end with ".com"<br>
